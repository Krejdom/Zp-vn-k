\section*{\Huge FALLING SLOWLY}
\emph{Glen Hansard \& Markéta Irglová}\\

\chord{C}I don't know you, \chord{F}but I want you, \chord{C}all the more for \chord{F}that.\\
Words fall through me and always fool me and I can't react.\\

\chord{Ami}Games that \chord{G}never amout\\
to \chord{F}more than they \chord{G}meant\\
\chord{Ami}will play \chord{G}themselvs \chord{F}out.\\

\emph{
\chord{C}Take this sinking \chord{F}boat and point it \chord{Ami}home\\
we've still got \chord{F}time.\\
\chord{C}Raise your hopeful \chord{F}voice, you had the \chord{Ami}choice\\
you've made it \chord{F}now.\\ 
}

Falling slowly, eyes that know me and I can't go back.\\
Moods that take me and erase me and I'm painted black.\\

You have suffered enough\\
and warred with yourself\\
it's time that you won.\\

Falling slowly, sing your melody, I'll sing along.
