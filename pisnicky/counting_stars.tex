\chord{Ami}Lately, I've been, \chord{C}I've been losing sleep\\
\chord{G}Dreaming about the things that \chord{F}we could be\\
But \chord{Ami}baby, I've been, \chord{C}I've been praying hard,\\
\chord{G}Said, no more counting dollars\\
\chord{F}We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars\\

I see this life like a swinging vine, swing my heart across the line\\
And my face is flashing signs, seek it out and you shall find\\
Old, but I'm not that old, young, but I'm not that bold\\
I don't think the world is sold, I'm just doing what we're told\\
I feel something so right, doing the wrong thing\\
I feel something so wrong, doing the right thing\\
I could lie, coudn't I, could lie\\
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive \hspace{1 cm}\textregistered \textregistered\\

I feel the love and I feel it burn, down this river, every turn\\
Hope is a four-letter word, make that money, watch it burn\\
Oh, but I'm not that old, young, but I'm not that bold\\
I don't think the world is sold, I'm just doing what we're told\\
I feel something so wrong, doing the right thing\\
I could lie, could lie, could lie\\
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly \hspace{1cm} \textregistered\textregistered\\

\emph{4$\times$} [Take that money, watch it burn, Sing in the river,\\
the lessons are learnt] \hspace{1 cm}... Everything that kills me makes feel alive
