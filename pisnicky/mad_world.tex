\chord{Emi}All around me are fa\chord{G}miliar faces\\
\chord{D}Worn out places - \chord{A}worn out faces\\
Bright and early for their daily races\\
Going nowhere - going nowhere\\
Their tears are filling up their glasses\\
No expression - no expression\\
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow\\
No tommorow - no tommorow\\

\textregistered: \emph{\chord{Emi}And I find it kind of \chord{A}funny, I find it kind of \chord{Emi}sad\\
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\\
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take\\
When people run in circles it's a very, very\\
\chord{Emi}mad \chord{A}World, \chord{Emi}mad \chord{A}World}\\

Children waiting for the day they feel good\\
Happy Birthday - Happy Birthday\\
Made to feel the way that every child should\\
Sit and listen - sit and listen\\
Went to school and I was very nervous\\
No one knew me - no one knew me\\
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson\\
Look right through me - look right through me\\

And large and your World, mad World
