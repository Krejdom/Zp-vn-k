~~~~~Emi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~~~~~B\7
     
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away.

~~~~~~~~Emi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~B\7

But you always knew that you'd be the one that work while they all play.

~~~Emi~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~B\7     

In youth, you'd lay, awake at night and scheme

~~~Emi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~~~B\7

of all the things that you would change, but it was just a dream.

Emi~~~~~G~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~B\7

Here we are, don't turn away~~~now,

Emi~~~~~G~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~B\7

we are the warriors that built this town.

From dust

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~B\7

The time will come, when you'll have to rise

~Emi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~~B\7

above the best, and prove yourself, your spirit never dies!

~~~~Emi~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~~~~~~~B\7~~

Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne above, 

~~~~~~~~~~Emi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cadd\9~~~~~~~B\7

but don't weep for me, 'cuz this will be the labor of my love
