\section*{\Huge HEY JUDE}
\emph{The Beatles}\\

Hey \chord{C}Jude, don't make it \chord{G}bad\\
Take a \chord{G\textsuperscript{7}}sad song and make it \chord{C}better\\
Re\chord{F}member to let her into your \chord{C}heart\\
Then you can start \chord{G\textsuperscript{7}}to make it \chord{C}better.\\

Hey Jude, don't be afraid\\
You were made to go out and get her\\
The minute you let her under your skin\\
Then you begin to make it better\\

\chord{C\textsuperscript{7}}And anytime you feel the \chord{F}pain, hey Jude, refrain \chord{Dmi}\\
Don't carry the \chord{G\textsuperscript{7}}world upon your \chord{C}shoulders\\
\chord{C\textsuperscript{7}}For well you know that it's a \chord{F}fool who plays it cool\\
\chord{Dmi}By making his \chord{G\textsuperscript{7}}world a little \chord{C}colder, da da da \chord{C\textsuperscript{7}}da da da \chord{G\textsuperscript{7}}da da da dá\\

Hey Jude, don't let me down\\
You have found her, now go and get her\\
Remember to let her into your heart\\
Then you can start to make it better, better, better...\\
