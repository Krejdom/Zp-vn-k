\chord{C}I've got my ticket for the long way 'round\\
\chord{Ami}Two bottles a whisky for the \chord{C}way\\
\chord{F}And I sure would like some \chord{Ami}sweet company\\
\chord{G}And, I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you \chord{C}say?\\

\emph{
When I'm \chord{Ami}gone, When I'm \chord{F}gone\\ 
\chord{C}You're gonna miss me when I'm \chord{G}gone\\
You're \chord{Ami}gonna miss me by my \chord{G}hair\\
You're \chord{F}gonna miss me every\chord{C}where, oh\\
\chord{G}you're gonna miss me when I'm \chord{C}gone\\

\emph{
When I'm gone, When I'm gone\\
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone\\
You're gonna miss me by my walk\\
You're gonna miss me by my talk,\\
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.\\
}

I've got my ticket for the long way 'round\\
The one with the prettiest of view's\\
It's got mountains, it's got rivers,\\
it's got sights to give you shivers\\
But it sure would be prettier with you \hspace{1 cm} \textregistered2 \hspace{0.5cm} \textregistered1 \hspace{0.5cm} \textregistered2
