\chord{D}This is the way you left me, \chord{A}I'm not pretending\\
\chord{Hmi}No hope, no love, no glory, \chord{G}no happy ending\\
This is the way that we love, like it's forever\\
Then live the rest of our life, but not together\\
}

\chord{Hmi}Wake up in the \chord{A}morning, \chord{G}stumble on my \chord{D}life\\
Can't get no love without sacrifice\\
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well\\
A little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell\\

\chord{Hmi}This is the hardest story, \chord{A}that I've ever told\\
\chord{G}No hope, or love, or glory, happy endings gone forever \chord{D}more\\
\chord{A}I feel as if I'm \chord{Hmi}wasted \chord{G}and \chord{D, A}I've wasted \chord{Hmi}every day\chord{G}\\

Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind\\
Can't get no rest, keep walking around\\
If I pretend that nothing ever went wrong\\
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on\\

This is the hardest story, that I've ever told\\
No hope, or love, or glory, happy endings gone forever more\\
I feel as if I'm wasted and I've wasted every day\\
